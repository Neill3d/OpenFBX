# OpenFBX and FBX Viewer

OpenFBX Library for loading an fbx scene without any dependeces on FBX SDK. Original OpenFBX by Mikulas Florek (https://github.com/nem0/OpenFBX)

The main goal is to load MotionBuilder scenes on Windows and Android platforms. The library is used in Project Tango Virtual Camera Project and offline FBX Viewer.

## FBX Viewer

Demo FBX Viewer is based on NVidia GameWorks Sample which is ready to be compliled on Windows and Android platforms.
Library is multiplatform as well.

Work in Progress!
